    <section class="story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Harmony Didn't Begin In A Restaurant.
It Began In A Small Kitchen, Shared By Two People Who Really Appreciated And Loved Each Other.

What Started As Late-Night Sandwiches And Quiet Cooking Together Slowly Became A Dream We Couldn't Ignore. We Cooked For Each Other First. Then For Friends. Then For People Who Quickly Became Part Of Our Little Circle.

Every Ingredient We Chose, Every Recipe We Tested, Carried A Piece Of Us — Our Story, Our Laughter, Our Struggles, Our Joy.

Harmony Isn't Just A Name.
It's The Feeling WE Always Shared Together, And We Want You To Experience It.

So From Our Hands, And Our Hearts, To You.</p>
